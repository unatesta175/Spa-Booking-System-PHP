## 👨‍💻 About This Project

This comprehensive spa booking and e-commerce system was **developed entirely from scratch** as a solo project during my internship at **Picrust** (February 2024 - July 2024).

> **⚠️ DISCLAIMER:** This project is developed **for educational and learning purposes only**. The logo, images, and brand assets used in this project are **not owned by me** and belong to their respective copyright holders. This is a portfolio project to demonstrate technical skills and is not intended for commercial use.

### 🎯 The Challenge

I challenged myself to build a complete, production-ready web application **using pure PHP without any frameworks** to truly understand web development fundamentals and test my coding abilities.

### 💪 The Journey

- **Duration:** 4 months of intensive development
- **Solo Developer:** Muhammad Ilyas Bin Amran
- **Technology Choice:** Vanilla PHP (no Laravel, no CodeIgniter, no frameworks)
- **Learning Experience:** Deep dive into PHP fundamentals, security, architecture, and best practices
- **Outcome:** A fully functional, feature-rich system managing real business operations

> *"Building without frameworks taught me how frameworks actually work. Every feature, every security measure, every optimization - I built it myself and understood it completely."*

## 🚀 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone or Download

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kapasbeautyspa.com.git

# Or download and extract the ZIP file
```

### 2️⃣ Setup Environment File

```bash
# Windows Command Prompt
copy env.template .env

# Windows PowerShell
Copy-Item env.template .env

# Linux/Mac
cp env.template .env
```

### 3️⃣ Configure Database

Edit the `.env` file:

```env
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=spa_db
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=

# ToyyibPay API (update with your credentials)
TOYYIBPAY_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
TOYYIBPAY_CATEGORY_CODE=your_category_code_here

# Application Settings
APP_ENV=development
APP_DEBUG=true
```

### 4️⃣ Import Database

1. Start your MySQL server
2. Create a database named `spa_db`
3. Import the database schema:
   - Access phpMyAdmin: `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`
   - Select the `spa_db` database
   - Import the SQL file (if provided) or create tables manually

### 5️⃣ Configure Web Server

#### For XAMPP:
1. Move the project to `C:\xampp\htdocs\`
2. Start Apache and MySQL from XAMPP Control Panel
3. Access the application at: `http://localhost/kapasbeautyspa.com/`

### 6️⃣ Create Required Directories

The `uploaded_img/` folder is used for user-uploaded content (product images, profile pictures, etc.) and is excluded from Git for privacy and size reasons.

```bash
# Create the uploaded_img folder if it doesn't exist
# Windows Command Prompt
mkdir uploaded_img

# Windows PowerShell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path uploaded_img

# Linux/Mac
mkdir -p uploaded_img
```

**Set proper permissions** (Linux/Mac only):
```bash
chmod 755 uploaded_img
```

> **Note:** This folder is automatically excluded from version control via `.gitignore` to prevent user-uploaded content from being committed to the repository. You will need to add your own product images and content after installation.

### 7️⃣ Access the Application

- **Main Website:** `http://localhost/kapasbeautyspa.com/`
- **Admin Panel:** `http://localhost/kapasbeautyspa.com/admin/`
- **Staff Panel:** `http://localhost/kapasbeautyspa.com/staff/`
